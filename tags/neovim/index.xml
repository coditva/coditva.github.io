      <description>As we come to the end of three months of the coding extravaganza as a part of GSoC, I would like to share the progress we made so far and what is left to do as a part of Improving the UI protocol in Neovim with Bj√∂rn Linse as my mentor.
What is in place  Grid based updatesThis post describes the grid-based updates in Neovim. The work for this is almost complete with tests and documentation in place.</description>

Neovim has come to be a very hackable, developer friendly version of Vim. It actually is what their website claims to be: literally the future of vim and Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability. One of the goals of nvim is to allow UIs to set different grid-sizes for each window and receive grid-based events.
Why do we need grid-based updates and different grid-sizes than what nvim sets?</description>

Two weeks have passed since the coding period began for Google Summer of Code on 14th May. After setting up my system in a room with a loud music system, I officially began coding.
The progress so far The first task that I needed to do was to break up the one global grid used for screen-handling into smaller per-window grids which would later let external UIs manage them individually.</description>

      <description>So, I got selected as a student applicant for the Google Summer of Code (or GSoC) and will be working with Neovim over the course of next three months!
Neovim is a fork of Vim, one of the most loved text editors that is used not only by the coding community but people from all over walks of life. I have been a devoted worshipper of Vim for about two years now and have fought in the Editor wars whenever the need arose.</description>
