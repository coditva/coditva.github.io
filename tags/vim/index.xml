      <description>So, I got selected as a student applicant for the Google Summer of Code (or GSoC) and will be working with Neovim over the course of next three months!
Neovim is a fork of Vim, one of the most loved text editors that is used not only by the coding community but people from all over walks of life. I have been a devoted worshipper of Vim for about two years now and have fought in the Editor wars whenever the need arose.</description>

      <description>Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote. I got a little busy with my acads is all. But not to worry because I have a new project at hand! Woohoo! And it&amp;rsquo;s finally what I really like to do; low level shiz and not WebDev.
Enough beating around the bush, let me introduce you to, &amp;lsquo;A Vim Story&amp;rsquo;, the new best way to learn Vim. The idea is to make a game out of it and let the user enjoy the steep learning curve, rather than dread it like I did.</description>
