      <description>Since I had switched to Elementary OS and I had to tweak it, I foraged the internet for a tweak tool and found it by the name of Elementary Tweaks. Although it looked promising, it soon turned out that it didn&amp;rsquo;t really offer that many customizations. But you can&amp;rsquo;t really blame the devs for this, as the EOS is built with a principle in mind to avoid configurations as much as possible.</description>

      <description>The new OS is in! Welcome, drumrolls Elementary OS 0.4 Loki. It was a hard decision really, leaving all the customizability of Ubuntu and switching to the somewhat constricted Loki. But the best part about it is that Loki doesn&amp;rsquo;t require that amount of customization. The UI looks, and feels, like a Mac but there are a few differences here and there. Actually, there are many. Nonetheless, being built from Ubuntu, the transition wasn&amp;rsquo;t much a difference, except for the escape from the Unity look that bored me to death.</description>
